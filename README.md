# about this project:

This project acts as a digital library. Book objects are stored in a Binary Search Tree structure. In this program, you can:

1. Add a book in the correct place (alphabetically by title)

2. Find, return, and edit the status of a particular book

3. Remove a book from the tree.

# node class

1. creates a new node and sets the new node to null

2. returns the string representation of the node

# binary search tree class

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

In a Binary Search Tree, for each node:

1. All nodes in the left subtree have values less than the node's value.
2. All nodes in the right subtree have values greater than the node's value.
3. This ordering property makes searching, insertion, and deletion operations efficient compared to other data structures.

# book class

Represents a book object
